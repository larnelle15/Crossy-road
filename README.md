# Crossy-road
Created a crossy road game clone using three.js, Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.

This has been one of my favorite games that i used to play on a daily as a kid and in learning so much about software and app development, this has been one of the projects i've wanted to make for the longest time. Using the 3D game visuals that THREE.js provides, I've been able to make this a reality and I'm excited for anyone who lands on my github to get to experience this with me. 

Here we go!
